In Python, the `if __name__ == "__main__":` construct is used to determine if a script is being run directly or imported as a module into another script.

- **When a script is run directly** (e.g., `python script.py`), the special variable `__name__` is set to `"__main__"`. This means the script's main functionality will execute under this condition.
- **When a script is imported as a module** into another script, `__name__` is set to the module's name instead, so the code inside `if __name__ == "__main__":` won’t run.

This is helpful for:
- **Preventing unintended execution**: Code in this block only runs when the script is executed directly, not when it’s imported.
- **Separating concerns**: It allows you to have reusable functions and classes in the script, while still enabling direct execution for testing or demonstration purposes.

Example:

```python
def hello():
    print("Hello, world!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    hello()
```

- Running the script directly will print "Hello, world!".
- Importing the script into another file will not execute `hello()`.
